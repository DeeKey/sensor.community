title: PCBs and circuit diagrams
---

The best way to build the DNMS is to use on of our PCBs.
There are now quite a lot of PCB manufacturer who can produce circuit boards for a few bucks with no minimum quantities. For example, [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).
Just download our circuit diagrams below, upload them at the manufacturer's website and order your PCBs. 

The last versions of the PCBs as described here. Refer to [Helmut Bitter's Github](https://github.com/hbitter/DNMS/tree/master/PCBs) for further informations and to access the KiCad files.

### AIRROHR V1.2
